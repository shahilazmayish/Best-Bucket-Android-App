							<h2 id="Introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
							<h4>1.1 Purpose</h4>
							<p>The app "Best Basket" is a daily grocery price comparison app from your near supermarkets. It seeks for various prices for products and gives you the best combination list of stores with delivery charge. It also provides up-to-date sales. Notifications about the new product, big sale etc. Currently this of mobile application does not exist. The project is being built for the customers to have the experience of grocery shopping cheap and easy.</p>
							<h4>1.2 Document Conventions</h4>
							<p>Bold face and bullet points are used to introduce a new topic or a specific subject matter. The rest of the document is written in regular Helvetica</p>
							<h4>1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions</h4>
							<p>The SRS document has been developed for many readers of different backgrounds. Different sections of this document will prove to be more important to some than others. Developers will want to focus on sections 2, 3, and 4. Other teams working with the same game will likely want to focus on section 2. Project managers will want to understand the product (section 2) and will want to review the non-functional requirements (section 5) and ensure they are implemented. The user will want to understand how the product works so will be interested in section 2 and 4.</p>
							<h4>1.4 Product Scope</h4>
							<p>The Competitive Grocery App System is will be both a web application and a mobile application designed to help</p>

							<h2 id="Overall">2. Overall Description</h2>

							<h4>2.1 Product Perspective</h4>
							<p>
								This kind of app allows the user to determine the best combination of the required products with delivery charge. It also makes and save grocery lists. Other features could be the ability to share lists with others, set reminders on default items (such as buying milk once a week), and updating lists in real time so others viewing them online will also see the changes.<br>Large online supermarket such as Shwapno, Meena Click, Chaldal, Othoba etc. now have their own website or app. Each supermarket chain has an app that offers varying features. However, the most common features are shopping lists, discounts/coupons to scan at checkout, and (more recently) delivery. But these applications are responsible for: that they restrict the user’s shopping to their particular brand/store. This works out beautifully if you only have one grocery store to shop at (like in a rural area). But as you explore grocery store options in a city-like area, you will find there are more stores/brands to choose from. The objective is to allow the user to add items from 3-4 different stores if needed.<br>This will provide users with a 360-degree view of the price list of the same product, without the restrictions typically imposed by having a fixed number of perspectives as one would typically find in a supermarket-specific grocery.
							</p>
							<h4>2.2 Product Functions</h4>
							<p>
								The major features are:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>List of grocery stores and products</li>
								<li>Virtual cart page</li>
								<li>Comparison Prices</li>
								<li>Set Reminder</li>
								<li>Push notifications</li>
							</ul>
							<b>Cross platform support:</b>This application can be accessed from any web browser as well as from mobile platforms: Android.<br /><br />

							<p style="font-size:90%">
								<i><center>Figure-1.1: Use-cases </i></center></p>
							<h4>2.3	User Classes and Characteristics</h4>
							<p>The major features are:
							<ul>
								<li>
									The user should be familiar with the concept of online shopping world. The concept of “Comparison on a specific product” gives the user to reveal different areas of shopping just in a short time that will be intuitive to all users, however some basic familiarity with some online shop like Daraz, Amazon.
								</li>
								<li>
									Setup and installation of this software on an Android mobile device will require regular installing app experience.
								</li>
								<li>
									Instruction on the use of an Android mobile device will not require any kind of expertise on the part of the user. Anyone with the basic knowledge of using android phone can easily use this application.
								</li>
							</ul>

							<h4>2.4 Operating Environment</h4>
							<p>This application will work on:<br><br>
							Any web browser on <em>Windows, Mac, Linux</em> and <em>Ubuntu</em><br>
							A downloadable app from Google Playstore for <em>Android</em> will be available for mobile platforms</p>
							<h4>2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>
									This app only supports a single user at a time.
								</li>
								<li>
									Network or internet connections are required to search the products.
								</li>
								<li>
									Android devices vary in capabilities / technology supported, and thus we cannot guarantee universal access to our application across all Android platforms.
								</li>
								<li>
									Android operating system is regularly updated by Google, and future iterations may not be compatible with current versions of API.
								</li>
								<li>
									The software will not be maintained by the developer following release, which may result in compatibility issues in the future.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<h4>2.6 User Documentation</h4>
							<p>
								We will keep the design simple and straight forward. And the instructions will be given after every steps. That’s why documentation is not that much important here but still there will a helpline option where users will be able to drop comments and requirements. So if needed we can improve the product.
							</p>
							<h4>2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Products Feeds are basically data of products info (price, size, image, description, all related to products) in well-structured form like XML or CSV or Excel or JSON.
								</li>
							</ul>
